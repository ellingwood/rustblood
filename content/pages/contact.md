# Example contact form

This form is setup to use Netlify's form handling:

- the form action is set to the current absolute url: `action: '/contact/'`
- a name attribute is sent with the form's data `'form-name': 'Contact'`
- netlify data attributes are added to the form `data-netlify data-netlify-honeypot`

Find out more in the [Netlify Docs](https://www.netlify.com/docs/form-handling/).
