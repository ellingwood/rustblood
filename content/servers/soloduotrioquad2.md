# The Server
The RustBlood Vanilla Trio server is built to be high performance, well moderated vanilla experience for players who do not wish to play on servers with large groups.
## Admin & Staff
To contact an administrator, the best method is to join **[Discord](https://discord.gg/bzT9Euc)** and #create-a-ticket
* Owner: Beach Haus
* Developer/Adminstrator: KyanG7
* Administrator: Maiden

## Wipe Cycle Information
* The vanilla trio always wipes at 5PM EST on Fridays - an announcement will be sent to the #announcements channel in Discord when reset and if it was a map or BP wipe.
* The map wipes weekly, while blueprints are wiped every other week.

## Rules
Below you will find a general set of server rules and guidelines. If you have questions or concerns about these rules or other situations while in game, please reach out to an admin in the **[RustBlood Discord](https://discord.gg/bzT9Euc)** for further clarification.

#### Group Guidelines
* The maximum players in a group is 3, whether they are online or offline.
* Players may be swapped out once per wipe cycle.
* All code locks must be re-configured with a different access code.
* All bags and beds must be destroyed.
* The tool cupboardâ€™s authentication must be cleared.
* A member of the group must submit a ticket in **[Discord](https://discord.gg/bzT9Euc)** in the #create-a-ticket channel with the username of the previous player and the new teammate to avoid being flagged for breaking the limit.

#### Trading Guidelines
* Trading must be performed through the use of shop fronts or vending machines.
* Breaking this rule puts you at risk of a server ban.

#### Toxicity & Abuse

* Do not be overly toxic. This is a catch-all rule and is up to the administrators discretion.
* Do not harass other players or the RustBlood staff members.
* Do not advertise on the server or in Discord.
* There is no rule against griefing or doorcamping.
* There is no leniency, you have been warned.

#### Cheating
* Scripting, hacking, or any form of cheating will be a permanent IP ban across all RustBlood servers.
* No VAC bans newer than 365 days.
* No game bans of any age.
* Guitar scripts are okay to use per the stance Facepunch takes.
